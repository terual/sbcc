SqueezeBox CopyCat (sbcc)
=========================

*   Use sbcc.py to run. If it does not find a sbcc.cfg file, it will 
    automatically create it. To rerun the setup, just delete the sbcc.cfg file.

*   This script mimics a Squeezebox on your network using the CLI interface to 
    your Squeezebox Server. It is written in Python and you need the
    pysqueezecenter package from http://code.google.com/p/pysqueezecenter/.

*   Also, it only runs on Linux.
